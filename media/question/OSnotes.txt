OS-Operating System
-Resource Management
-Interface
-Rduce the bulkyness of the application
-Isolation and Protection

OS is piece of software that manages all the resources of a computer system,both hardware and software and provides an environment 
in which the user can execute his/her programs in a convi=enient and efficient manner by hidding underlying complexity of the hardware 
and acting as resource manager

Goals Of OS
1.Maxmize the CPU utilization
2.Reduce Process Starvation
3.High priority execution

Types of OS
1.Single process OS (MS DOS)
2.Batch Processing OS(ATLAS)
3.Multi Programming OS(THE)
  -Context Switching
4.Multi Tasking OS(CTSS)
   -Time shearing
5.Multi Processing OS(Windows)
6.Distributed OS
7.Real TIme OS

Thread :- 
   -Light weight Process
   -Independantly executes

---------------------------------------------------------
   Multi Tasking                  |     Multi Threading
--------------------------------------------------------------
1.More than  1 process concept    | More than 1 treades
2.Isolation and memory protection | Not Isolation adn memory protection
3.Process scheduling              | Threads scheduling
4.No.of cpu =1                    |No.of CPU>=1


Componenet of OS
 1.User space  :-Apps are run here 
                -GUI (Graphical user interface)
                -CLI (Command line interface)

 2.Kernel      :-Access to underlying hardware
               :-Heart of OS

function of kernel :
   -Process management
     -process creation ,termination
   -Process and thread schedule
   -Process Syncronization
   -Process Communicate
   -Memory Management
     -Allocate,deallocate
   -Free space management
   -File management
     -creat,delete,directory Management
   -I/O management
     -Spooling
     -Buffreing
     -Caching


Types of kernel
1.Monolithic kernel 
   -Fast communication between diff component of kernel 
   -Less realiable
   e.g Linux & Ubix DOS
2.Micro Kernel
  -Less bulky ,More reliable,stable
  -Perfromance less
  e.g L4 linux , Symbian OS
